    "The term **[data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** is rather vague and does *not* refer to an academic discipline. Instead, the term was popularized by the tech industry, who also coined non-meaningful job titles such as \"[rockstar](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas)\" or \"[ninja developers](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas).\" Most *serious* definitions describe the field as being **multi-disciplinary** *integrating* scientific methods, algorithms, and systems thinking to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data, *and* also emphasize the importance of **[domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, this integration aspect feeds back into the academic world. The [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), for example, created the new [Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing](http://computing.mit.edu) for [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) with a 1 billion dollar initial investment where students undergo a \"bilingual\" curriculum with half the classes in quantitative and method-centric fields - like the ones mentioned above - and the other half in domains such as biology, business, chemistry, politics, (art) history, or linguistics (cf., the [official Q&As](http://computing.mit.edu/faq/) or this [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/mit-college-artificial-intelligence.html)). Their strategists see a future where programming skills are just as naturally embedded into students' curricula as are nowadays subjects like calculus, statistics, or academic writing. Then, programming literacy is not just another \"nice to have\" skill but a prerequisite, or an enabler, to understanding more advanced topics in the actual domains studied. Top-notch researchers who use programming in their day-to-day lives could then teach students more efficiently in their \"language.\""

Someone - like Guido - starts a project and makes it free to use for anybody (e.g., on a code-sharing platform like [GitHub](https://github.com/)). People find it useful enough to solve one of their daily problems and start using it. They see how a project could be improved and provide new use cases (e.g., via the popularized concept of a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). The project grows both in lines of code and people using it. After a while, people start local user groups to share their same interests and meet regularly (e.g., this is a big market for companies like [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) or non-profits like [PyData](https://pydata.org/)). Out of these local and usually monthly meetups grow yearly conferences on the country or even continental level (e.g., the original [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/) in the US, [EuroPython](https://europython.eu/), or [PyCon.DE](https://de.pycon.org/)).

    "Besides being **free** as in \"free beer,\" a major benefit of open-source is that one can always *look up how something works in detail*: That is the literal meaning of *open* source and a difference to commercial languages (e.g., MATLAB) as a programmer can always continue to *study best practices* or find out how things are implemented. Along this way, many *errors are uncovered*, as well. Furthermore, if one runs an open-source application, one can be reasonably sure that no bad people built in a \"backdoor.\" [Free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) is consequently free of charge but brings *many other freedoms* with it, most notably the freedom to change the code."

    "[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) (cf., this [introduction](https://www.learncpp.com/)) are wide-spread and long-established (i.e., since the 1970s) programming languages employed in many mission-critical software systems (e.g., operating systems themselves, low latency databases and web servers, nuclear reactor control systems, airplanes, ...). They are fast, mainly because the programmer not only needs to come up with the **business logic** but also manage the computer's memory \"manually\" - and the knowledge necessary to do that is not easy to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Python automatically manages the memory for the programmer. So, speed here is a trade-off between application run time and engineering/development time. Often, the program's run time is not that important: For example, what if C needs 0.001 seconds in a case where Python needs 0.1 seconds to do the same thing? When the requirements change and computing speed becomes an issue, the Python community offers many third-party libraries - usually also written in C - where specific problems can be solved in near-C time."
