Instead, the term was popularized by the tech industry, who also coined non-meaningful job titles such as \"[rockstar](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas)\" or \"[ninja developers](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas).\" Most *serious* definitions describe the field as being **multi-disciplinary** *integrating* scientific methods, algorithms, and systems thinking to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data, *and* also emphasize the importance of **[domain knowledge <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge)**.\n",

Their strategists see a future where programming skills are just as naturally embedded into students' curricula as are nowadays subjects like calculus, statistics, or academic writing.

    "Python itself is just a specification (i.e., a set of rules) as to what is allowed and what not: It must first be implemented (c.f., next section below). The current version of Python can always be looked up in the [Python Language Reference <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_py.png\">](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). To make changes to that, anyone can make a so-called **[Python Enhancement Proposal <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_py.png\">](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)**, or **PEP** for short, where it needs to be specified what exact changes are to be made and argued why that is a good thing to do. These PEPs are reviewed by the [core developers <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_py.png\">](https://devguide.python.org/coredev/) and interested people and are then either accepted, modified, or rejected if, for example, the change introduces internal inconsistencies. This process is similar to the **double-blind peer review** established in academia, just a lot more transparent. Many of the contributors even held or hold positions in academia, one more indicator of the high quality standards in the Python community. To learn more about PEPs, check out [PEP 1 <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_py.png\">](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) that describes the entire process.\n",
