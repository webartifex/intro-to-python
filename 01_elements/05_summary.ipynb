    "We end each chapter with a summary of the main points (i.e., **TL;DR** = \"too long; didn't read\"). The essence in this first chapter is that just as a sentence in a real language like English may be decomposed into its parts (e.g., subject, predicate, and objects), the same may be done with programming languages.\n",

    "  - **sequence** of **instructions** that specify how to perform a computation (= a \"recipe\")\n",
    "  - a \"black box\" that processes **inputs** and transforms them into meaningful **outputs** in a *deterministic* way\n",
    "  - conceptually similar to a mathematical function $f$ that maps some input $x$ to an output $y = f(x)$\n",

    "  - instructions that **\"do\" something** and **have side effects** in memory\n",
