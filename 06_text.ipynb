    "In this chapter, we continue the study of the built-in data types. Building on our knowledge of numbers, the next layer consists of textual data that are modeled primarily with the `str` type in Python. `str` objects are naturally more \"complex\" than numerical objects as any text consists of an arbitrary and possibly large number of individual characters that may be chosen from any alphabet in the history of humankind. Luckily, Python abstracts away most of this complexity."

    "The *relational* operators also work with `str` objects, another example of operator overloading. Comparison is done one character at a time until the first pair differs or one operand ends. However, `str` objects are sorted in a \"weird\" way. The reason for this is that computers store characters internally as numbers (i.e., $0$s and $1$s). Depending on the character encoding, these numbers vary. Commonly, characters and symbols used in the American language are encoded with the numbers 0 through 127, the so-called [ASCII standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). However, Python works with the more general [Unicode/UTF-8 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) that understands every language ever used by humans, even emojis."
