    "We started out in this chapter by realizing that Python provides us no good data type to model a vector $\\vec{x}$ or a matrix $\\bf{A}$. Then, we built up two custom data types, `Vector` and `Matrix`, that wrap a simple `tuple` object for $\\vec{x}$ and a `tuple` of `tuple`s for $\\bf{A}$ so that we can interact with their `._entries` in a \"natural\" way, which is similar to how we write linear algebra tasks by hand. By doing this, we extend Python with our own little \"dialect\" or **[domain-specific language <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)** (DSL).\n",

However, for the domain of linear algebra this would be rather pointless as there is already a widely adopted library with [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) that not only has a lot more features than ours but also is implemented in C, which makes it a lot faster with big data.\n",
